# Sims1Pack (s1pk)

## Overview

Sims1Pack, also known as ``s1pk``, is a custom ZIP-based format designed for managing Sims 1 content. This format is particularly useful for organizing and distributing custom content within the Sims 1 community.

## S1Util

**S1Util** is a straightforward command-line package manager designed to work seamlessly with the s1pk format. It simplifies the process of <!-- adding and --> extracting content from s1pk files.

At this present stage, only the extraction process is possible. Packaging needs to be manually.

### Usage

To use S1Util, follow this simple command structure:

```shell
s1util --file <path to file> --directory <path to directory>
```

**Note:** On Windows, S1Util defaults to the Ultimate Edition install directory. For other platforms, you will need to set the directory manually.
